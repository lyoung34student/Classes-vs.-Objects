# Classes-vs.-Objects
Hello class and Professor,

In object-oriented programming, objects and classes are fundamental concepts that simplify code organization and structure. Objects are occurrences of classes that represent specific things with attributes and behaviors. Objects can have attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that define their characteristics and actions. For example, in a car rental system, a "Car" object can have attributes such as make, model, color, and price, along with behaviors like accelerate, brake, and honk. Classes serve as outlines that define the structure and behavior of objects. In the car rental system example, the "Car" class would define the structure of all car objects. The main conceptual differences between objects and classes include abstraction vs. concrete implementation, specification vs. implementation, class vs. instance, and design vs. instance creation. Understanding these differences is crucial for designing integrated and maintainable codes that promote code reusability, and overall program efficiency in software development.

Abstraction vs. Concrete Implementation: Classes provide a high-level abstraction of objects, defining a blueprint for creating instances with specific properties and behaviors. On the other hand, objects represent tangible instances of classes with concrete values assigned to their attributes. In simple terms, classes are like a recipe for creating objects, while objects are the actual dishes made from that recipe.

Specification vs. Implementation: Classes specify the structure and behavior of objects, defining what attributes and methods they will have. They act as a contract that outlines the properties and actions that objects of that class can exhibit. Objects, on the other hand, implement the specifications laid out by the class, embodying the defined attributes and behaviors in a concrete instance.

Class vs. Instance: A class is a defined data type that describes a set of objects with common properties and behaviors. It acts as a template or blueprint for creating instances (objects) that belong to that class. Each object created from a class is unique and independent, with its own set of attribute values and method invocations.

Design vs. Instance Creation: Classes are designed during the software design phase, outlining the structure and behavior of objects within the system. They serve as a blueprint for creating instances of objects during runtime, using the "new" keyword to allocate memory and initialize the object's attributes. Objects are created dynamically during program execution, instantiating classes to generate unique instances with specific properties and behaviors.
